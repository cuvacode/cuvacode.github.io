    <h1 class="ui header">A <strike>home</strike> workplace away from your workplace.</h1>
    <p>Traditional 9-to-5 jobs are not for everybody. I learned that lesson firsthand after jumping from position to position, wondering why I couldn't commit to any for longer than 18 months.</p>
    <p>After taking the leap and deciding to go off on my own, I quickly found out that there was a world of things I was missing by renting out my brain for someone else's agenda.</p>
    <p>I got to pursue on my own projects, define my day, and work from home. The dream had been realized! Until, no longer was I inspired to put on pants for the day. Nor share the things I was learning with other people. I decided it was time to try the co-working craze.</p>
    <p>Except, that didn't work either. I was surrounded by freelancers of all kinds - copywriters, marketers, 3D animators. People who were extremely talented in what they were pursuing, but our common ground was that we both liked tacos.</p>
    <p>I also noticed that by attending a co-working space, I was giving up any opportunity to actually get things done. It seemed that I excelled at becoming more social, but to the point where it had a negative effect on my productivity.</p>
